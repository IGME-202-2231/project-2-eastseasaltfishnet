## AI Tank (Enemy Boss)

  - The enemy will look for the best way around the obstacle and will continue to track the player after it has gone around the obstacle.

  - To: Searching Player when obstacles have been circumvented or the current position is beyond the edge of the map.
 
  #### Steering Behaviors
1. Avoid Walls:  ****IMPORTANT* the forece return from the method AvoidObstacle in agent only helps in detemine do enemy need to turn or not. Basilcy it will turn the enemy to the best direction and apply a force toward the front. To match the way the tanks move***ï¼š  
2. Serach Player: A force will be applied toward the front of the tank (this fits the way a tank move)

#### Obstacles
- **Walls**: Hidden objects that have the tag obstacles.


#### Separation
- **Important**: The enemy dont have separation, but since there is only one enemy I think it is reasonable. So to compensate I added separation to the other two agents,  
the missile have a really weak separation force but the hp box have a strong one

- Seek Target: The missile heads straight for the player's location.
- Avoid Walls: A force directly toward top will be apply and it will pull the missile up.
